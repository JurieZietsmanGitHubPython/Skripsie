Decision Support Tool for Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the working code of the decision support tool developed for my final year project of my BEng (Industrial) degree. 
The tool takes as input some .csv file which contains rows of opinionated text.
The .csv file should take on the shape of the comment (opinionated text) in the first column and the polarity of this comment (positive, negative, neutral) in the second column.
The output of the tool (after processing), shows the best type of data representation to use for the text supplied when predicting sentiment classes.
